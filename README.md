# Mask

An interactive educational tool for understanding masking in machine learning and neural networks.

## 🎯 Overview

This project provides two interactive components to help you understand masking concepts:

1. **Quiz Section**: Test your knowledge about masking with 5 questions covering fundamental concepts
2. **Interactive Matrix Tool**: Visualize how different types of masks work with real-time matrix operations

## 🚀 Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to start learning!

```bash
# Open the file directly in your browser, or serve it locally:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```
